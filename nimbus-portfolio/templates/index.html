<section id="about" class="callout primary">
  <h1>Welcome, and thank you for visiting!</h1>
  <p>
    I’m <strong>Ilker Senturk</strong>, a QA Automation Engineer with 7+ years of experience designing and implementing scalable test automation frameworks for both web and API platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
    I specialize in <strong>Selenium</strong>, <strong>Playwright</strong>, and CI/CD integrations using <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> and <strong>Jenkins</strong>. My focus is building maintainable automation solutions that integrate seamlessly into modern DevOps pipelines.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm also proficient with <strong>Docker</strong>, using it to create consistent testing environments and simulate production-like setups through Docker Compose — improving reliability across both development and CI environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having worked closely with both functional and integration teams, I understand the critical importance of collaboration in feature development and system-wide integration testing.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m passionate about <strong>machine learning</strong> and data engineering — leveraging tools like <strong>pandas</strong>, <strong>scikit-learn</strong>, and <strong>seaborn</strong> to turn raw test data into actionable insights.
  </p>
  <p>
    This entire portfolio is deployed on <strong>AWS</strong> using <strong>Lambda</strong>, <strong>API Gateway</strong>, <strong>ECS (Fargate)</strong>, <strong>RDS</strong>, and <strong>S3</strong> — all provisioned via <strong>Terraform</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>“Continuous learning, thoughtful engineering, and a passion for quality — that’s what drives my work.”</em>
